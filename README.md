# firefox-extensions
My collection of firefox extension I have made

Which currently includes:
1. Screen time tracker (published) - tracks screen time on websites
2. tab grid (published) - shows tabs in a grid view
3. global themer (No longer in development) - allows you to change the theme of websites globally
4. Web shortcuts (Moved to my website as a custom language) - Automate your web tasks with a powerful shortcut editor
5. Sharing (complete but no longer in develpment) - share the link of the current page or highlighted text with a click
6. Custom Homepage (Mostly finished) - Get an android like homepage with widgets and shortcuts
7. Calculator - just a simple calculator extension that opens a popup
8. Mobile Tools - just some random tools that are usually on mobile

Probably more to come when I come up with ideas

I dont plan to make these for chrome
