# firefox-extensions
My collection of firefox extension I have made

Which currently includes:
1. Screen time tracker - tracks screen time on websites
2. tab grid - shows tabs in a grid view
3. global themer (No loner in development) - allows you to change the theme of websites globally
4. Web shortcuts - Automate your web tasks with a powerful shortcut editor
5. Sharing - share the link of the current page or highlighted text with a click

extension Ideas im considering
1. Permission Monitor - log when sites accessed specific permissions
2. AI Assistant - control websites and find info like google assistant
3. Custom Homepage - that was customizable with widgets and apps (would be links to websites)
4. Quick settings - would include options to configure all other extensions including theme on a custom page, would have a quick settings menu (like on android) and a dynamic island like thing that would be toggleable

Probably more to come when I come up with ideas

I dont plan to make these for chrome
