# firefox-extensions
My collection of firefox extension I have made

Which currently includes:
1. Screen time tracker - tracks screen time on websites
2. tab grid - shows tabs in a grid view
3. global themer (No loner in development) - allows you to change the theme of websites globally
4. Web shortcuts - Automate your web tasks with a powerful shortcut editor
5. Sharing - share the link of the current page or highlighted text with a click

extension Ideas im considering
Permission Monitor - log when sites accessed specific permissions
AI Assistant - control websites and find info like google assistant
Custom Homepage - that was customizable with widgets and apps (would be links to websites)
Dynamic island - show notifications, set times show media and dowloads etc
theme manager - change a theme which would apply to all my extentions

Probably more to come when I come up with ideas

I dont plan to make these for chrome
