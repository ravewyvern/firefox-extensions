# firefox-extensions
My collection of firefox extension I have made

Which currently includes:
1. Screen time tracker - tracks screen time on websites
2. tab grid - shows tabs in a grid view
3. global themer - allows you to change the theme of websites globally
4. Web shortcuts - Automate your web tasks with a powerful shortcut editor
5. Sharing - share the link of the current page or highlighted text with a click

Probably more to come when I come up with ideas

I dont plan to make these for chrome
